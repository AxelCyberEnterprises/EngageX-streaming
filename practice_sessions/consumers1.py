# Reworked version to store chunks locally, compile on the server, and upload only the final video to S3.
# This version addresses:
# - Race condition with file cleanup (further refined)
# - Incorrect type for SessionChunk serializer 'session' field
# - Returning the compiled video URL to the frontend via WebSocket
# - Logging the total time for compilation/upload
# - Improved robustness for waiting on background tasks
# - Removed premature cleanup of media_path_to_chunk
